Submitted by: **Gabriela Araujo**

This web app: **CardioBrain Trivia** is a fun and educational flashcard app designed to work out your brain with general knowledge questions and surprising fun facts. Each card flips to reveal an answer plus a curiosity that keeps you learning in a playful way.

Time spent: **2.5 hours** spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

  - [x] A list of card pairs is created
  - [x] The total number of cards in the set is displayed

  - [x] Only one half of the information pair is displayed at a time
- [x] **Clicking on the card flips the card over, showing the corresponding component of the information pair**
  - [x] Clicking on a card flips it over, showing the back with corresponding information 
  - [x] Clicking on a flipped card again flips it back, showing the front

## Notes

Challenges I faced during development:
- Resetting the flip state correctly when switching cards, while only using `useState`.
- Structuring clean component communication without overcomplicating logic.
- Designing a clean card display that clearly separates question, answer, and fun fact without visual overload.
